    <h1>For You, X</h1>
    <div class="heart">‚ù§Ô∏è</div>
    <p>Anytime I am with you, I never want to leave. I wish I could be with you forever and have the world at our feet. Not caring what others have to say about us but only caring about ourselves.</p>
    <p>I want to complete you and give you all the love you deserve. But love is never truly enough, because most times people fall out of love. I want to be there when you need me and love you despite all your flaws.</p>
    <p>Forget everything people have to say. Love for yourself, not because of friends or family. Sometimes I wish you'd give me a chance to truly know me instead of the misconception you have towards me.</p>
    <div class="lightning">‚ö°</div>
    <p>You are the sweetest person I know‚Äîgentle, calm, and caring despite all trauma. Don't change for anyone. Continue being you, but add a sprinkle of kindness, and you're good to go!</p>
    <footer>Forever yours, with love. üíú</footer>
